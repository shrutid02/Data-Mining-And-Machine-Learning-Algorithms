# Artifical Neural Networks using Keras
Problem Statments:

1. Using the [Keras](https://keras.io/api/) library, create an artifical neural network with number of hidden nerons as follows: X = (4, 16, 32, 64, 128)
2. For every value of x in the above mention set X, fit the neural network using the training data and validate the neural network using the given validation data
3. Plot a figure, where the horizontal x-axis is the number of hidden neurons, and the vertical y-axis is the accuracy. Plot both training and validation accuracy in the figure.
4. Analyze the plot and choose the optimal number of hidden neurons from the analysis.
5. Report the test accuracy using the given test data on the neural network with the optimal number of hidden neurons.
