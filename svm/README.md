Problem Statements:

1. Report the number of Class 1 and Class 0 samples in dataset
2. Report the number of Class 1 and Class 0 samples after dividing the dataset using stratified random sampling
3. Take SVM with linear kernel as classifier and set the regularization parameter C as: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10], respectively. 
For each value of C, train an SVM classifier with the training data and get the number of support vectors. 
Generate and analyze a plot with C as the horizontal axis and the number of SVs as the vertical axis.
4. Compare the performance of four different kernel functions: linear, polynomial, radial basic function (Gaussian kernel), and Sigmoid. For each type, train and evaluate an SVM classifer and record accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure scores.
